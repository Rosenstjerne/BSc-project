the most remevant thing here would be to differentiate between scopes and give them intermidiate names, maybe mased on their line no
and also create new (nested?) symbol talbes

for every body we need to :
  
  We need to collect all class declerations and save their name, cattegory (class) and also all of its elements, to the current symbol table
  
  We need to collect all variable declarations and save their names and types to current symbol table
  
  We need to collect all functions and save their names, return types, parameters and their types and the new body of the function in our current syntax table 

  For all the statements we need to chech if any identifier corespond with a legal variable name pressent in its scope. For all bodies found here 
  we also save the body to our current symbol table and give it an intermidiate name (based on the line no?)

We need to save the root of the symbol table so we can use it again in type checking.
