We need to make a list for every function with every variable in it (not nested in another function). In other words, we remove all scoping eccept the ones from the functions
(can only be done with a visotor)

This list should have unique names for all the variables.
    To do this we can use a visitor to collec

We need a list of all non simple types and how large they are, ass well as a mapping of every attibute in a class to an index so we can treat it as an array.
