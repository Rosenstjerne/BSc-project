we use the following registers as intermediate registers for expressions and such:

%r8
%r9
%r10
%r11
%r12
%r13
%r14
%r15

We use a liveliness analysis and a graph coloring algorithm to "color" our
pseudo intermediate registers with the "colors" of the real registers.

For any chromatic number (minimal needed colors needed to color the graph from the liveliness analysis)
above 8, we will allocate some space on the stack at the begining, and keep a pointer to it at all times in a
register. These will the be accesed indirectly with an offset when needed
